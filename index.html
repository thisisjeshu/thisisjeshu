        <section class="what-we-believe">
            <h2>What We Believe</h2>
            <p>We believe we are a significant part of what God is doing in India and all over the world. We honor and bless every congregation that names Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah as Lord.</p>
            <p>We worship One God revealed in Three persons.</p>
            <p>Yeshua is Lord and Messiah.</p>
            <p>Sin separates us from God.</p>
            <p>Yeshua the Messiah is the only solution to sin.</p>
            <p>The Holy Spirit gives us the power to live in victory over sin now and into eternity.</p>
            <p>God calls us to deliver His message and do His works.</p>
            <p>We believe the teachings of the Bible and strive to put them into practice in everyday life.</p>
